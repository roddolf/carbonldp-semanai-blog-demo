# Carbon LDP JavaScript ES2015 Boilerplate

Boilerplate that shows how to setup Carbon LDP SDK in a JavaScript ES2015 application.

This boilerplate uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) as a module loader which also bundles the code and serves the app. Other setups could use other module loaders like [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/), 
[browserify](http://browserify.org/) or no module loader at all (although that would mean no support for `import` statements).

## Setup

### Install dependencies
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (we recommend installing the "Current" version)
2. Install the project's dependencies by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the application with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
This will run a `webpack-dev-server` instance that will server the project's files.

### NPM Scripts

`package.json` defines the following tasks:

- `build`: Generates the final distribution version
- `clean:dist`: Cleans `dist` directory
- `start`: Runs `server:dev`
- `server:dev`: Runs Webpack bundler in dev mode and starts the app


### Generating the production version

To generate the production version, just run this command:

```bash
npm run build
```

It will generate the `dist` folder with the production-ready files.
